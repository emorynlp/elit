def binarize(tree: Tree):

    Conducts binarization over the tree.

    First, the tree is transformed to satisfy `Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)`_.
    Here we call :meth:`~tree.Tree.chomsky_normal_form` to conduct left-binarization.
    Second, all unary productions in the tree are collapsed.

    Args:
        tree (tree.Tree):
            The tree to be binarized.

    Returns:
        The binarized tree.

    Factorizes the tree into a sequence.

        delete_labels (set[str]):
            A set of labels to be ignored. This is used for evaluation.
            If it is a pre-terminal label, delete the word along with the brackets.
            If it is a non-terminal label, just delete the brackets (don't delete childrens).

            Default: ``None``.
        equal_labels (dict[str, str]):
            The key-val pairs in the dict are considered equivalent (non-directional). This is used for evaluation.
            The default dict defined in `EVALB`_ is: {'ADVP': 'PRT'}
            Default: ``None``.
